# SCC Coloring Algorithm in parallel with C

For each implementation (openCilk, openMP, pthread) there is a separate branch,
with master branch being the single thread implementation.

The `Makefile` on each branch is different and macos specific, but you should
easily be able to compile the code by changing the `CC` variable and running 
`make`.

If you need any help or find any bug, you should open a github issue.
